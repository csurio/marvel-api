## Prerequisites

Before running the Marvel API Client, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Java 17 or later
- Maven
- MySQL database (if required for your configuration)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Marvel API Client locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://csurio@bitbucket.org/csurio/marvel-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd marvel-api-client
   ```

3. Create a MySQL database (if required) and configure the database connection in `application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/marveldb?allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=root_password
   ```

4. Build the application using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/marvel-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

The Marvel API Client should now be running locally.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`, where you can explore and test the available endpoints.

To access secured endpoints, you will need to obtain a JWT token by registering or logging in. Use the token in the `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer your_token` for authentication.

## Deploying to a Server

To deploy the Marvel API Client to a server, follow these general steps:

1. Build the application as described above.

2. Copy the generated JAR file (`marvel-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`) to your server.

3. Ensure that Java 17 (or later) is installed on your server.

4. Configure your server environment (e.g., set environment variables, configure database access).

5. Start the application on your server:

   ```bash
   java -jar marvel-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.jar
   ```

The Marvel API Client should now be up and running on your server.
